- 704e031: attempt two to fix build scripts and github publishing

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- abe4873: synchronize release toolinig

  We've switched to using changesets for the release management
  of this package. Since the tag "v0.1.0" had already existed,
  the github release wasn't updated. This change should bring
  Github Release and NPM version in sync again.

  There is no change to the syntax highlighting code.
